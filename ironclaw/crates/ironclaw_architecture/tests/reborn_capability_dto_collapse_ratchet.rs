//! Anti-slippage ratchet for the capability-path DTO collapse (§3/§9/§10 of
//! `docs/reborn/2026-07-17-architecture-simplification-dto-dyn-local.md`).
//!
//! §1.1 showed a single capability call re-wrapped through ~5 near-identical
//! request shapes plus an overloaded ten-variant result enum. §3 collapses those
//! onto the `host_api` vocabulary (`Invocation`/`Authorized`/`Resolution`). §9 is
//! explicit that during the migration the type count *rises before it falls*
//! (~14 → ~18 → ~11) while the new vocabulary and the old shapes coexist, and
//! that **"the §10 mirror-DTO ratchet's allowlist is what makes this safe: the
//! old [shapes] are frozen entries that may only disappear."**
//!
//! This is that ratchet. It freezes the current set of collapse-target DTOs and
//! fails on any change:
//!
//! - a **second definition** of a frozen name (a downstream crate re-declaring an
//!   upstream request "for decoupling" — the exact §1.1 Mechanism 1 failure) —
//!   flagged by the multiplicity check;
//! - **deleting** one without trimming [`FROZEN_COLLAPSE_DTOS`] also fails — so
//!   the allowlist shrinks in lock-step as the collapse lands (§10: compare set
//!   membership, never a count), and reviewers watch it get shorter toward the
//!   §3 end state (`Invocation` + the surviving per-lane requests + the five
//!   result channels — zero mirrors).
//!
//! Definition of done for this axis: every entry below is deleted (its fields
//! now carried by `Invocation`/`Authorized`, its result variants by
//! `Resolution`), and this file is deleted with the last of them (enforced —
//! the test fails on an empty allowlist).
//!
//! Owner: the §3 capability-path collapse slice series under the #6168
//! umbrella (authorize → dispatch → result-channel migration) trims this list
//! in the same PRs that delete the types; reviewers hold additions to zero.
//!
//! Scanner semantics (shared with the other §10 ratchets — see
//! [`ratchet_support`]): comments/strings stripped before matching; covers
//! `pub`/`pub(crate)`/`pub(super)`/`pub(in …)`; skips `tests/`/`examples/`/
//! `benches/`; line-based, not cfg-aware.
