//! Anti-slippage ratchet for the deployment-mode *branching* axis (§4.4 / §10
//! of `docs/reborn/2026-07-17-architecture-simplification-dto-dyn-local.md`).
//!
//! Its two siblings own deployment mode as a **type name**
//! (`reborn_localdev_typename_ratchet`, `reborn_deployment_mode_typename_ratchet`).
//! This one owns the behaviour those names were a symptom of: **code that
//! reads a deployment mode to decide what to do.**
//!
//! §4.4 is explicit that mode and lane get opposite treatment, and why:
//!
//! > A deployment mode must be branched on in exactly **zero** places past the
//! > composition edge — that is the whole §2.1 thesis — so giving it an enum
//! > would hand every crate an invitation to `match` on it (which is precisely
//! > how the 66-identifier `LocalDev*` family grew).
//!
//! `RebornCompositionProfile` *is* such an enum. It survives as the CLI/env
//! parse artifact and as a display label; what must not survive is consumers
//! reading its variants to select behaviour. `DeploymentConfig` (§5.6) is where
//! a profile becomes data — substrate, traffic policy, readiness contract,
//! storage shape — and everything downstream reads those fields.
//!
//! ## What this freezes
//!
//! The **set** of production files under `crates/ironclaw_reborn_composition/src`
//! that name a `RebornCompositionProfile` variant. Set membership, not a count,
//! per §10: a count lets a new violation silently replace a retired one; only
//! set membership catches a *swap*. A file entering the set fails; a file
//! leaving it must be removed from the allowlist in the same PR, so the debt
//! can only shrink.
//!
//! This is deliberately coarser than "detect a `match`": variant paths are what
//! branching needs, and a line-based scan cannot reliably tell
//! `match p { Profile::X => .. }` from `if p == Profile::X` from
//! `matches!(p, Profile::X | ..)` — all three are the same debt.
//!
//! ## Definition of done
//!
//! The allowlist reaches `{deployment.rs}` — `DeploymentConfig::for_profile`,
//! the one place a profile name becomes deployment data. The remaining entries
//! and why each is still here are documented on the allowlist itself.
//!
//! **Owner:** the #6274 driver (Illia Polosukhin) — the person driving this
//! allowlist to `{deployment.rs}`. §10 requires every ratchet to name one; an
//! unowned ratchet is telemetry, not a gate.
//!
//! Scanner semantics: comments and string literals are stripped before
//! matching, so this file's own doc comment and fixtures do not self-trip.
//! Skips `tests/`, `examples/`, `benches/` trees and `*tests.rs` files —
//! test fixtures naming a profile are not production branching.
