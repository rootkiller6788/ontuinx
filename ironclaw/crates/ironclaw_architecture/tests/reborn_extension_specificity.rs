//! Concrete-name specificity gate for the unified extension runtime.
// arch-exempt: large_file, unified extension specificity ratchet stays centralized, plan #6175
//!
//! Goal (docs/reborn/extension-runtime/overview.md §1): no generic crate
//! contains a concrete product name, vendor id, or vendor API host. The
//! forbidden vocabulary is **derived from the bundled package inventory**
//! (`crates/ironclaw_first_party_extensions/assets/` plus the test fixture
//! inventory `tests/fixtures/extensions/`), so a future `discord` package is
//! caught without editing this scanner (checklist TEST-6).
//!
//! Scope: the `src/` tree and `Cargo.toml` of every generic Reborn workspace
//! crate, plus the WebUI frontend sources. Excluded, by category:
//!
//! - **Concrete extension crates** (`CONCRETE_EXTENSION_CRATES`) — they *are*
//!   the product code.
//! - **The package inventory crate** (`ironclaw_first_party_extensions`) —
//!   it owns the concrete packages and their native executors.
//! - **Sanctioned assemblers** — `ironclaw` (the binary assembles
//!   the native factory registry; overview §4.0) and this architecture crate
//!   (names terms on purpose).
//! - **Legacy-layer / v1 crates** — the v1 enclave is being strangled
//!   wholesale, not policed term-by-term (same footing as
//!   `reborn_retired_taxonomy.rs`).
//! - **Test code** — tests may name concrete products (overview §8); `tests/`
//!   directories, `tests.rs` / `*_tests.rs` files, and `#[cfg(test)]` blocks
//!   inside `src/` are stripped before matching.
//!
//! Term-collision carve-outs (`TERM_COLLISIONS`, `PATH_TERM_COLLISIONS`):
//! some inventory-derived identifiers are *also* vocabulary of a different
//! product domain that legitimately and permanently lives in generic crates.
//! Exactly four such domains exist: LLM providers (`nearai`/`api.near.ai` is
//! the assistant's LLM+embeddings backend; Google is Gemini; GitHub is
//! Copilot), WebUI browser-login SSO providers (Google/GitHub OIDC), GitHub
//! as a skill/code host (skill installation from repositories), and
//! vendor-specific safety detection — leak/secret scanners must know
//! Slack/GitHub token shapes, and the trace payload-redaction/side-effect
//! classifier must know which tool-name keywords carry messaging/email/
//! issue-tracker payloads (a safety denylist that is a *superset* of the
//! inventory, so it cannot be sourced from the inventory without weakening
//! redaction). Bare `nearai` terms are carved out globally with the
//! compound extension forms (`nearai_mcp`, `private.near.ai`, …) still
//! scanned; the rest are path-scoped. Each carve-out names its collision and
//! fails when stale; adding one for any other reason is a violation of this
//! gate's purpose.
//!
//! Allowlist discipline (checklist TEST-7): `ALLOWLIST` enumerates today's
//! violations as exact `(path, term)` pairs. A new violating pair fails; a
//! stale pair (the file no longer matches the term) also fails, so the list
//! can only shrink. It must be **empty** by P7 (checklist DEL-8).
//!
//! Every remaining entry is **lane-4 residue** (grouped below by category with
//! a `// lane-4:` marker): a genuine generic branch, the deferred `nearai_mcp`
//! catalog slice, a one-time migration call site, the web-access assembly
//! module, an incidental doc/tool-string example, or the sanctioned DEL-7
//! dev-dependency. None is a first-party package-catalog name — Lane A cleared
//! those. Each is characterized in the PR #6065 lane-4 inventory and is the
//! owner's next decision: do NOT casually "fix" one — degenericize by routing
//! on a manifest capability, or carve deliberately with a one-line justification.
