//! The generic outbound delivery coordinator (extension-runtime §5.4,
//! OUT-1..7).
//!
//! Sending a message decomposes into two halves: **semantics and
//! reliability** (target resolution, authorization, attempt persistence,
//! retry, crash recovery — identical for every channel, owned here,
//! once) and **vendor mechanics** (rendering, splitting, API selection,
//! error mapping — owned by each extension's
//! [`ChannelAdapter::deliver`](crate::ChannelAdapter)).
//!
//! Rules this module owns:
//! - Every user-visible channel output is a semantic [`DeliveryIntent`];
//!   emitters never know what channel the user is on (OUT-1).
//! - An attempt is persisted (`Prepared`→`Sending`) **before** any vendor
//!   egress (OUT-3); the coordinator is the sole delivery-state writer —
//!   adapters get no store and cannot mark anything delivered (OUT-4).
//! - A crash after possible vendor success leaves `Sending`; recovery marks
//!   it `Unknown` and never blindly resends (OUT-6).
//! - Once any part of a multipart delivery is sent, a later retryable part
//!   failure is terminal — a whole-envelope retry would duplicate the parts
//!   the vendor already accepted (OUT-7).
