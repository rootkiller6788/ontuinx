//! Deployment configuration: a deployment mode is policy *data* resolved at
//! the composition edge, never a type the kernel or a substrate names.
//!
//! This is the Slice B artifact of
//! `docs/reborn/2026-07-17-architecture-simplification-dto-dyn-local.md`
//! (§4.4 "Eliminate `Local*`", §5.6 "The deployment interface — modes are
//! data"). Each deployment target is one [`DeploymentConfig`] value built by a
//! named constructor; the difference between local-dev, local-dev-yolo, and
//! the hosted volume preview is readable on this one page as data.
//!
//! Two deliberate boundaries:
//!
//! - The sanctioned resolver in `ironclaw_runtime_policy` stays the **only**
//!   producer of [`EffectiveRuntimePolicy`]; [`DeploymentConfig::resolve`] is
//!   a thin adapter over [`ResolveRequest`], not a second policy engine.
//! - Storage roots, workspace paths, and connection pools are runtime
//!   *handles*, not deployment policy — they continue to ride
//!   `RebornStorageInput`. This value carries only the policy request.
