//! Credential lifecycle cleanup handler.
//!
//! Extension-keyed cleanup only. The request is built WITHOUT a provider
//! selector, so this route revokes/deactivates the extension's OWN accounts,
//! strips its grants, and (on uninstall) cancels the extension's own
//! `LifecycleActivation` flows via the package selector — but it never
//! selects the caller's reusable per-provider personal credentials and never
//! cancels other flows on the provider. Full uninstall cleanup (exclusive
//! personal-credential revocation) lives in
//! `extension_host/extension_lifecycle.rs::revoke_exclusive_credentials`.
//! Canceled turn-gate denials and setup-PKCE-verifier deletion are handled
//! server-side inside `cleanup_credentials_for_lifecycle` before the report
//! is serialized; the `#[serde(skip)]` handoff fields never cross this
//! boundary.
