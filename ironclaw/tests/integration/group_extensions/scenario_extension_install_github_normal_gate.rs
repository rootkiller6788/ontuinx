//! Negative install case for the provider-instance readiness map: a provider with no
//! instance-config requirement (github has no entry in the readiness map —
//! only providers with an OPERATOR-level OAuth backend need one) must not
//! false-positive on the readiness check — installing it must still raise the
//! NORMAL per-account `BlockedAuth` gate. Pins CURRENT behavior; must stay
//! green after the readiness-map implementation lands.
//!
//! Uses "github", not telegram: telegram is feature-available here, but
//! empirically (verified against this exact harness) its setup resolves
//! through a SEPARATE `ExtensionAccountSetupRegistry`/pairing mechanism that
//! needs a live `AccountConnectionStatusSource` this bare harness never
//! mounts (`telegram/telegram_host_beta.rs`'s `connect()` call is a
//! production/serve-time wiring step) — so an unseeded install here hits
//! a pre-existing, unrelated "host unavailable" error instead of the
//! per-account credential gate this test targets, and would misrepresent the
//! contract under test. github resolves through the SAME generic
//! product-auth credential-account mechanism as google/notion (the
//! mechanism `scenario_extension_install_reauth_gate` already proves
//! raises a real `BlockedAuth` gate for an unsatisfied requirement), so it
//! is the honest in-catalog stand-in for a readiness-map-absent provider.
//! Runs on github's EXISTING setup-needed install from Scenario 1 (never credentialed,
//! never credentialed there) — no fresh install, mirroring how Scenario 7
//! reconciles the same pre-existing install.
