//! Scenario 8 (T5 of issue #6105; the #4556/#2939/#1327 failure shapes):
//! RESTART SURVIVAL of connected-channel state. After the Slack lifecycle
//! scenario (scenario 6) leaves Slack reconnected and active, this reopens
//! the durable stores at the same on-disk local-dev `storage_root` through
//! FRESH handles — independent of every live `Arc` the running group holds —
//! and asserts the state a process restart must reconstruct is actually
//! there:
//! - the active Slack identity binding (the durable "connected" evidence),
//!   read through a fresh generic `ChannelIdentityStore` composed
//!   exactly the way production boot composes it;
//! - the Slack extension installation record (the durable "installed"
//!   evidence).
//!
//! Deliberately NOT claimed: the in-memory capability publication surviving —
//! production re-publishes tools on (re)activation over this same durable
//! state, and scenario 6's reinstall arm already pins that path. This
//! scenario pins the durable half a restart depends on; full process-restart
//! coverage belongs to the #6106 boot/upgrade gates.
//!
//! Ordering: depends on scenario 6 (connected end state); driven after it in
//! `main.rs`.
