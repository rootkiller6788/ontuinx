//! Shared-persistence group infrastructure for Reborn integration tests.
//!
//! A **group** owns shared storage (composite filesystem, product workflow
//! harness, capability backend) AND one shared turn runtime (coordinator +
//! scheduler) exactly once; each [`RebornIntegrationGroup::thread`] call builds
//! a per-thread workflow (binding + inbound service + scripted-gateway
//! registration) over that one shared runtime. Within one group, state written
//! by thread A is visible to thread B — the key e2e persistence contract.
//! Separate groups are separate test binaries, fully isolated. A single-shot
//! [`RebornIntegrationHarness::test_default()`] is a degenerate one-thread
//! group (its own storage, baseline = 0).
//!
//! ## Group test binary layout
//!
//! ```text
//! tests/reborn_group_approvals/
//!     main.rs                         // one #[tokio::test], drives scenarios in order
//!     scenario_gate_then_resolve.rs   // pub async fn run(g:&RebornIntegrationGroup)->HarnessResult<()>
//!     scenario_approve_always_persists.rs
//! ```
//!
//! One sequential `#[tokio::test]` drives all scenarios (Cargo doesn't
//! guarantee order or share state across `#[test]` fns in one binary). Use `?`
//! for *dependent* scenarios (failure stops the driver) and
//! `report.record(name, scenario::run(&g).await)` for *independent* ones
//! (failure recorded, others continue).
//!
//! ### Subdir module paths (required)
//!
//! Each group `main.rs` MUST declare BOTH `#[path]` overrides, each with
//! `#[allow(dead_code)]` — bare `mod support;` resolves relative to the
//! group's own subdir and fails to compile:
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! #[allow(dead_code)] #[path = "../support/mod.rs"] mod reborn_support;
//! #[allow(dead_code)] #[path = "../../support/mod.rs"] mod support;
//! ```
//!
//! ### Two composites — use the right one
//!
//! - [`RebornIntegrationGroup::turn_composite`]: thread/turn history read-back.
//! - [`RebornIntegrationGroup::capability_harness`]: capability stores
//!   (memory, projects, extensions, secrets, approval/auto-approve).
//!
//! Do NOT read memory or approval state from `turn_composite()` — the
//! host-runtime capability stores live in a **separate** filesystem inside
//! the `HostRuntimeCapabilityHarness`, not in the integration composite.

// Shared by all group test binaries; symbols read as dead when a binary
// does not exercise every variant.
#![allow(dead_code)]
